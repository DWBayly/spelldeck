Ex: Twistus Fatius
TF is a card mage. As his action he may throw a card from his magic deck. 
By default, TFâ€™s deck starts in Top Deck mode, where he draws and immediately uses whatever card is on top. The cards have abilities which range from combat abilities like shooting a fireball, utility abilities, like summoning a length of rope, to cards that change the mode of his deck. Cards may be added or removed from his deck as a form of level up.
